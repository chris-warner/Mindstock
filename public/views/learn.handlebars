					<h2>Advantages of Mutual Funds</h2>
					<h5>Diversification:</h5> <strong>Mutual funds spread their holdings across a number of different investment vehicles, which reduces the effect any single security or class of securities will have on the overall portfolio.</strong>
					<hr>
					<h5>Liquidity:</h5>
					<strong>
						Mutual funds, unlike some of the individual investments they may hold, can be traded daily. Though not as liquid as stocks, which can be traded intraday, buy and sell orders are filled after market close.
					</strong>
					<hr>
					<h5>Convenience:</h5>
					<strong>Choosing a mutual fund is ideal for people who donâ€™t have the time to micromanage their portfolios</strong>
